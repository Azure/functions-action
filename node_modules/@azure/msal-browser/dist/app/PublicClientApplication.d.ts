     * Constructor for the PublicClientApplication used to instantiate the PublicClientApplication object
     *
     * Important attributes in the Configuration object for auth are:
     * - clientID: the application ID of your application. You can obtain one by registering your application with our Application registration portal : https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredAppsPreview
     * - authority: the authority URL for your application.
     * - redirect_uri: the uri of your application registered in the portal.
     *
     * In Azure AD, authority is a URL indicating the Azure active directory that MSAL uses to obtain tokens.
     * It is of the form https://login.microsoftonline.com/{Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here}
     * If your application supports Accounts in one organizational directory, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with the Tenant Id or Tenant name (for example, contoso.microsoft.com).
     * If your application supports Accounts in any organizational directory, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with organizations.
     * If your application supports Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with common.
     * To restrict support to Personal Microsoft accounts only, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with consumers.
     *
     * In Azure B2C, authority is of the form https://{instance}/tfp/{tenant}/{policyName}/
     * Full B2C functionality will be available in this library in future versions.
